# ickabog-ebook

Generates ebooks for The Ickabog by J.K Rowling. Original text from https://www.theickabog.com/home/

## Dependencies:

- `wget`

You should have `ickabog.epub`, and `ickabog.pdf` in your directory after the script finishes.

## Cover

Currently no cover is available. If you'd like to submit a cover for this book, please let me know. I think a kid-drawn illustration would be perfect, keeping with the theme of the contest.
